I recently reached out to people that I consider to be influencers in the Jekyll static site generator community. These are users passionate enough to contribute code snippets, blog about using Jekyll and open source themes to the community. They aren't core contributing team members, but rather regular users like you and I.

I asked these influencers to share some of their opinions and experiences of Jekyll. I explored what they love, what makes them facepalm, and where they would like to see Jekyll and it's community headed.

The response I had was awesome and I wanted to share my findings so that if you aren't using Jekyll already you might be convinced to give it a try.

To help set the scene, the average length of Jekyll use by respondents was almost 2 and a half years with some relatively new and two almost pushing 5+ years. Jekyll is currently used by half for personal projects only, the other half using it for both personal and professional work.

My first big question was "What do you love about Jekyll?"

# The TL;DR:
Top 5 most common reasons to love Jekyll:

1. Simple to understand how it works
2. Easier than other CMS
3. Sites are stable
4. Sites are fast
5. Control over the system

# If I may generalise even further:
It would seem to me that those 5 most common answers for loving Jekyll are really subsets of two larger comforts for developers:

1. You understand exactly what's happening: HTML + CSS/SASS + Markdown get fed in and compiled, and those components themselves are easy to manipulate with minimal new learning. That gives you power and confidence.
You love what gets spit out - static site files are extremely easy to handle: their speed, security and stability are all amazing.

2. Predictability cannot be overvalued for developer peace of mind!
